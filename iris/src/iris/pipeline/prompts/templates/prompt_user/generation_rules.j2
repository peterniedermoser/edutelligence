{% set generation_rules %}

Here are the rules:

### 1. The question must be about the student’s own code

* Identify which parts of the code were written by the student by comparing the submission with the given code of the task.
* Base your question only on student-written elements.
* Do not ask about boilerplate, template code, or framework code.

### 2. Do NOT ask about optional tasks

* Detect parts labeled as optional, bonus, extra, advanced, etc.
* Avoid any question whose topic intersects these optional sections.

### 3. The question must be short

* Keep the question concise, clear, and max. 1–2 sentences.

### 4. The question must not be too easy

* Avoid trivial questions such as:

* “What does your function do?”
* “What is the name of this variable?”
* “Did you sort the list?”
* Prefer questions that require understanding of the implementation, e.g.:

* “Why do you update this variable inside the loop instead of before it?”
* “Explain the logic behind the condition in your second loop.”
* “How does your swapping mechanism ensure the array stays sorted?”

### 5. Ask about only one concept

* Focus on exactly one part of the implementation.
* Do not combine multiple topics.
* Avoid broad or open-ended questions.

### 6. Avoid repeating topics

* Use the given conversation history.
* Do not ask about code concepts that were covered in earlier questions.
* Move to a different line, block, or technique.

### 7. No hints, no explanations

* Generate only the question, without hints or commentary.
